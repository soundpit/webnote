             <p>Web Note collects vast amounts of data in the day to day running of the business, whether you are a client, browsing the site or someone who sent us a enquiry through our online contact form.</p>
    
    <h4>What do you do with this information?</h4>
    
<p>As of 12th March 2014, Web Note is required to comply with the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APP's) outlined in Schedule 1 of the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012, which amends the Privacy Act 1988.</p>
   
    <p>As a result Web Note manages your information in an open and transparent way. This includes having an up to date APP privacy policy. This privacy policy must cover topics like:</p> <br/>
    <ul id="privacy_list">
      	<li>The kinds of personal information we collect.</li>
      	<li>What we do with the information.</li>
      	<li>Why we collect the information.</li>
      	<li>How an individual can access their information</li>
      	<li>How an individual may complain about a breach of the APP's</li>
      	<li>If the organisation will disclose information to overseas recipients.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h4>What information do we take?</h4>
    
    <p>Our goal is to collect only the minimum information we need in order to conduct efficient business with you, our valued customer. </p>
    
    <h4>Browsers</h4>
    <p>When a user navigates to our website we collect anonymous information such as ip address, browser type and version, and if available which site you are coming from. We use this information for research purposes only, which helps us build a more focus and efficient website.</p>
    
    <h4>Casual Enquiries</h4>
    
    <p>Users contacting us through our online question form only need to give an email address as well as their question. You don't need to give a name.</p>
    
    <h4>Who has access to your information?</h4>
    
    <p>Your information is well protected while it is with us. Only a small fraction of Web Note employees are authorized to view your data. Data is always held on-site, and never taken home. Our databases are backed up regularly and all your information is encrypted.</p>
    
     
    <p>While some companies sell your information to other organisations for marketing purposes, Web Note is against this practise. Your information will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided.</p>
    <h4>What we cannot take from you</h4>
    
    <p>Please be aware that there are few things we cannot and should not ask of you.</p>
    <p>We cannot ask for your real name. Of course to supply it to us willingly would help us a great deal, but if you don't want to identify yourself when dealing with us, or you would like to use an alias then we are happy with that. We just want something to call you by.</p>
    <p>We also cannot ask you for any government related identifiers. Drivers Licence number, Medicare number, centrelink number etc. If Web Note employee asks you for those numbers, then you may politely refuse.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I find out what information about me you have stored?</h4>
Absolutely! Just call us or send us an email and someone will call you back to arrange access.
    
    <h4>What if my information is wrong?</h4>
    <p>Web Note is legally obliged to have our information about you as correct and up-to-date as possible. We would love to hear from you if this is wrong. Tell us and we will fix it straight away. We have procedures in place to help you.</p>
